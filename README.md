:night_with_stars: Astrophotography for Android

Application to help automate the process of taking and stacking pictures of the sky.

It allows one to fiddle with ISO, Shutter speed and aperture only once and then letting go of the phone. The app will proceed to take a multiple pictures using the same settings and then stack them together to reduce noise.

Roadmap:

- Fix image alignment on all devices
- Pre-processing screen that allows users to remove some images from the final stack
- Object tracking to better stack images that would otherwise leave a star trail

:warning: **This is still a Work in process and has only been tested on a handful of devices** :warning:
